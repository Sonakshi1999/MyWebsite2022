Hi! My name is Sonakshi Gupta, often known as 'Sona' by my friends and family. I was born and brought up in India and I went to Singapore Management University to pursue a Bachelors in Business Management, with a double major in Finance and Information Systems. Living in Singapore exposed me to many different kinds of experiences that I cherish to date. It also helped me become the confident and independent person I am.


Travelling has been a major part of my life. My family, filled with wanderlust, always believed in exploring many different countries and terrains. Seeing the northern lights in Reykjav√≠k, sailing across the Danube River that divides Buda from Pest, snorkeling over the Great Barrier Reef in Cairns and going for safari through the grasslands of Masai Mara in Kenya are just some of the experiences that I have garnered over the past few years. 

Apart from this, trying various types of cuisines is what I believe helps me connect with the local culture of any place. I also enjoy painting and reading in my free time. Adventure sports like sky diving, scuba diving and bungee jumping are just some of the ways for me to assuage my addiction to adrenaline rush.
