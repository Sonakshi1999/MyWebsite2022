With the society becoming more and more aware of what is affecting the environment, many individuals are shifting to bike usage as compared to cars. With this project, we want to analyse what could be the factors that affect increase or decrease in bike rentals in London.

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

```
#### Let's have a look at the data

```{r skim_data}

skimr::skim(bike0)

```

First, we need to clean the data to make it easier to perform data visualisation on it.
```{r lubridate}
# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```


#### How many bikes were hired per month and year since 2015?

We plot a density plot to find out the distribution of the bikes per month since 2015.
```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

#create facet_grid
bike %>%
  filter(year > 2014) %>%
  ggplot(aes(bikes_hired)) +
  geom_density() +
  facet_grid(vars(year),vars(month)) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Bikes Hired per month since 2015",
    x = "Distribution of Bikes Hired",
    y = NULL
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.y=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y=element_blank())


```

Next, we try to find the difference in expected and actual bikes hired in London between 2017-2022. Here, we have calculated expected based on the monthly averages between 2016-2019.

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

# calculate expected bikes hired using 2016-2019
expected <- bike %>%
  filter(year >= 2016 & year <=2019) %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  mutate(expected_monthly = mean(bikes_hired)) %>%
  select(expected_monthly, month)

# calculate actual monthly average of bikes
actual <- bike %>%
  filter(year >= 2017) %>%
  group_by(year, month) %>%
  mutate(actual_monthly = mean(bikes_hired))

# combined the two dfs  
final <- left_join(actual, expected, by = 'month') %>%  
  mutate(diff = actual_monthly - expected_monthly)

final %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=month, month = 1)) +
    geom_line(aes(y = expected_monthly, group =1), color="#0096FF", size = 1.5) +
    geom_line(aes(y = actual_monthly, group = 1)) +
  # geom_ribbon to add green
    geom_ribbon(aes(
      ymax = expected_monthly, 
      ymin = pmin(diff, 0) + expected_monthly), 
      fill = "#C70039", 
      alpha = 0.4,
      group = 1) +
  # geom_ribbon to add red
    geom_ribbon(aes(
      ymax = actual_monthly, 
      ymin = actual_monthly - pmax(diff,0)), 
      fill = "#007500", 
      alpha = 0.4,
      group = 1) +
  # facet by year
    facet_wrap(~year)+
    labs(title = "Month changes in TfL bike rentals", 
         subtitle = "Change from monthly average shown in blue and calculated between 2016-2019", 
         caption = "Source: TfL, London Data Store", 
         x = "Months",
         y = "Bike rentals")+
    theme_bw()
```

One important thing to note in this graph is that since, 2016-2019 average values are included in calculating the expected bikes hired, the line for the actual bikes hired does not vary too much from the expected. But, for 2020 to 2022, we can clearly observe a lot more variations.

Now, we do the same thing but keeping in mind the weekly averages of bikes hired.

```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

#calculate actual bikes hired
bike_week1 <- bike %>%
  filter(year > 2016) %>%
  group_by(year, week) %>%
  mutate(mean_bikes = mean(bikes_hired))

#calculate expected hired bikes
bike_week2 <- bike %>%
  filter(year >=2016, year <= 2019) %>%
  group_by(week) %>%
  mutate(expected_hired = mean(bikes_hired))

# join the two tables and calculate percent_change
bikes_week <- bike_week1 %>%
  full_join(bike_week2, by="week") %>%
  mutate(
    pct_change = (mean_bikes - expected_hired)/expected_hired,
    color_id = pct_change > 0)

#create plot
ggplot(bikes_week,
       aes(x = week)) +
  annotate("rect",fill ="grey",alpha = 0.5,xmin = 14,xmax = 26, ymin =-Inf,ymax =Inf) +
  annotate("rect",fill ="grey",alpha = 0.5,xmin = 40,xmax = 52, ymin =-Inf,ymax =Inf) +
  geom_line(aes(y = pct_change)) +
  facet_wrap(~year.x) +
  
  #fill the pct_change under 0%
  geom_ribbon(
    aes(ymin = 0,
        ymax = pmax(0,pct_change),
        fill = "red"),
    alpha = .4) +
  
  #fill the pct_change over 0%
  geom_ribbon(
    aes(ymin = pmin(0, pct_change),
        ymax = 0,
        fill = "green"),
    alpha = .4) +
  
  #create geom_rug()
  geom_rug(aes(color=color_id),sides = "b") +
  
  
  #format the plot
  labs(
    title = "Weekly changes in TfL bike rentals",
    subtitle = "% changes from weekly averages calculated between 2016-2019",
    x = "Week",
    y = NULL
  ) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")


```

We decided to use mean, because the data showed seasonal trends and there were not many clear outliers, which would affect the data. 

##### Moreover, from the data we observed that the significant highs or lows were attributed to certain events that took place during the time period. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic was one of the reasons that we saw decrease in hires as the country was in lock-down. But, once the country opened up we observed that people wanted to avoid the crowded public transport due to fear of infection and hence, resorted to biking.
