I believe it is also important to see if the political affiliations that the voters had affected the way they voted to leave the European Union or not.
```{r brexit_challenge}

brexit <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kostis-christodoulou/am01/master/data/brexit_results.csv")

# renaming the columns
brexit <- brexit %>%
  rename(Conservative = con_2015,
         Labour = lab_2015,
         LibDems = ld_2015,
         UKIP = ukip_2015)

# pivoting the table longer
brexit_longer <- brexit %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = Conservative:UKIP,
    names_to = "party",
    values_to = "count"
  )

color_party = c("#0087DC", "#E32636", "#FAA61A", "#6D3177") #assigning party colors to a vector

ggplot(brexit_longer,
  aes(
    x = count,
    y = leave_share
  )) +
  geom_point(aes(color = party), alpha = 0.4)  +  
  scale_color_manual(values = color_party) +
  #adding trend lines
  geom_smooth(data = brexit,
      aes(x = Conservative, y = leave_share), 
      color = color_party[1],
      method = "lm",
      se = TRUE) +
  geom_smooth(data = brexit,
      aes(x = Labour, y = leave_share),
      color = color_party[2],
      method = "lm",
      se = TRUE) +
  geom_smooth(data = brexit,
      aes(x = LibDems, y = leave_share),
      color = color_party[3],
      method = "lm",
      se = TRUE) +
  geom_smooth(data = brexit,
      aes(x = UKIP, y = leave_share),
      color = color_party[4],
      method = "lm",
      se = TRUE) +
  
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +
  
  
  labs(
    title = "How political affiliation translated to Brexit Voting",
    x = "Party % in the UK 2015 General Elections",
    y = "Leave % in 2016 Brexit Referedum"
  ) 
```

We plotted the percentage of those who voted to leave against the percentage of people with various party affiliations.

The plot showed that **UKIP** seemed to have a strong positive correlation. This aligns with their ideology of 'Euroscepticism'. The party members were huge supporters of Brexit and hence, were one of the driving forces of encouraging the vote.
