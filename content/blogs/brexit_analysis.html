title: Analysis of Brexit Votes in 2015

<p>I believe it is also important to see if the political affiliations that the voters had affected the way they voted to leave the European Union or not.</p>

<p>We plotted the percentage of those who voted to leave against the percentage of people with various party affiliations.</p>
<p>The plot showed that <strong>UKIP</strong> seemed to have a strong positive correlation. This aligns with their ideology of ‘Euroscepticism’. The party members were huge supporters of Brexit and hence, were one of the driving forces of encouraging the vote.</p>
